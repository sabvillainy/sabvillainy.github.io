            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Sabri Yılmaz. I am a Computer Programming student at Izmir University of Economics.
                </p><p>
                Currently, I am enrolled in an Associate's degree program with the goal of transitioning into a
                Bachelor's
                degree in Computer Engineering through Turkey's "Dikey Geçiş Sınavı (DGS)". This transition is my
                primary academic objective as I aim to deepen my knowledge and expertise in the field.
                </p><p>
                My journey into the world of programming began with a curiosity for how software works, and it has since
                evolved into a deep commitment to learning the art of coding and problem-solving.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I have a keen interest in software development, game design, and AI technologies. My dream in my software
                development career is to create a widely-used, appreciated, and popular program that people love.</p>
            <p>I am familiar with several programming languages, including Java, C#, SQL, HTML and CSS.
                Additionally, I am currently expanding my skill set by learning the Spring Framework and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>As a programmer, I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. I enjoy working with diverse teams
                to bring ideas to life, leveraging each team member's strengths to achieve common goals. My ultimate aim
                is to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact, whether they are academic, professional, or
                personal endeavors.</p>
            <p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong advocate for continuous learning and improvement. I
                regularly engage with the latest industry trends, tools, and best practices to ensure that my knowledge
                and skills remain current and relevant in the fast-paced field of technology.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Currently, I am eager to apply my skills and enthusiasm in an internship position to contribute to
                innovative projects and further my professional development. If you're interested in hiring me, check

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>In my spare time, I have a deep passion for music and gaming. I play electric guitar, bass guitar, and
                drums, and I am an active member of my university's music group. My love for music extends beyond
                playing instruments; I also have an extensive music collection, including vinyl records, CDs, and
                cassettes, which I treasure.</p>
            <p>I have been a computer game enthusiast since childhood, with a particular fondness for RPGs. Gaming has
                always been a significant part of my life, providing both entertainment and a way to connect with others
                who share similar interests.</p>
            <p>Like many, I enjoy watching movies, TV shows and reading books during my free time. Recently, I have
                developed a strong interest in films, especially those considered cult classics. When it comes to
                reading, I am drawn to classic novels and philosophical works, finding both to be incredibly enriching
                and thought-provoking.</p>
            <p>These hobbies not only provide relaxation but also fuel my creativity and broaden my perspective,
                contributing to my overall personal and professional growth.</p>
