            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Sabri YÄ±lmaz. I am a Computer Programming student at Izmir University of Economics.
                My journey into the world of programming began with a curiosity for how software works, and it has
                since evolved into a deep commitment to mastering the art of coding and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Throughout my academic career, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks,
                allowing me to tackle complex problems and develop efficient, scalable software solutions. I thrive on
                challenges and enjoy the process of breaking down intricate problems into manageable pieces, which I can
                then solve systematically using code.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong advocate for continuous learning and improvement. I
                regularly engage with the latest industry trends, tools, and best practices to ensure that my knowledge
                and skills remain current and relevant in the fast-paced field of technology.</p>
            <p>As a programmer, I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. I enjoy working with diverse teams
                to bring ideas to life, leveraging each team member's strengths to achieve common goals. My ultimate aim
                is to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact, whether they are academic, professional, or
                personal endeavors.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am eager to apply my skills and enthusiasm in an internship position to contribute to
                innovative projects and further my professional development. If you're interested in hiring me check out

            <br>
            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>I am a multi-instrumentalist with a passion for playing electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. I
                actively perform with my university's music band, contributing to our vibrant music community. Beyond
                performing, I am an avid music collector, with a diverse collection of vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes
                spanning numerous genres. My love for music knows no bounds.</p>
            <p>In addition to my musical pursuits, I am a dedicated video game enthusiast, always exploring new virtual
                worlds and challenges. As a cinephile, I enjoy delving into the art of filmmaking and appreciating
                cinematic masterpieces. Furthermore, I am an avid reader of philosophy books, constantly seeking to
                expand my understanding of the world and its complexities.</p>
